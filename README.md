# Python Birthday Lookup & Update Tool

## Overview
This simple Python script demonstrates how to use **dictionaries** and **loops** to build an interactive **birthday lookup tool**. It allows users to search for birthdays, and if the name is not found, they can add new entries on the fly.

## Features
- Preloaded dictionary of names and birthdays
- Interactive lookup via user input
- Add new entries dynamically
- Infinite loop with option to quit by submitting blank input

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Python dictionaries and key-value storage
- Use `while True` loops and conditional logic
- Accept user input with `input()`
- Dynamically update data structures during runtime

## Sample Output
```bash
Enter a name: (blank to quit)
> Alice
Apr 1 is the birthday of Alice

Enter a name: (blank to quit)
> John
I do not have birthday information for John
What is their birthday?
> Oct 20
Birthday database updated.
```
